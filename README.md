## Hello world ! 👋

👩‍💻 From HR to Web Development..
After 13 years juggling numbers between HR and Finance, I decided to switch to web development.

🔭 I’m currently working on expanding my web development skills through projects and challenges at Wild Code School.
🌱 Right now, learning JavaScript, React, Express and best practices for clean and efficient code.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting web development projects and open-source contributions.
💬 Ask me about my transition from HR to web development or tips for coding bootcamps (or for anything else !)
📫 Keep in touch ! I'm ready for new challenges 🚀
